## Image Caption Generator

An image caption generator basically generates decsriptions of what is going on in a given image. This is a natural human ability to look at an image and pay attention to the curcial information in the image and describe it in just a few words. Can a machine do this? Using tools such as natural language processing and object detection (computer vision), it is possible to train a model to do this task. This will be explored in this project. 

Image caption generator bears applications in assistive technology and can help visually imapired to infer their surroundings. 
It can also be extended to uses such as map descriptions for users/self-driven cars. 
The primary goal of the project will be to learn Deep learning and NLP tools to build a model that can analyse the images and comprehend the meaning from given captions.

### Dataset:

The dataset that will be used for this is the Flickr8k which can be found here:

This dataset consists of about 8000 image files and captions for the same.

### Deployment:

A simple web application will be built using streamlit that will ask the user for an image and generate a caption for the given image. 

### Outcome:

Through this project we will build an image caption generator that will generate captions for a user given image.
