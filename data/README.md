## Data

Dataset used for this project is the one commonly used for image captioning called the Flickr8k. This dataset consists of 8000 image files and a CSV file with nearly 40000 rows, each row consisting of a caption and the name of the image file that it decsribes.

This dataset can be found in kaggle as mentioned in the final proposal.
