## Data

Dataset used for this project is the one commonly used for image captioning called the Flickr8k. This dataset consists of 8000 image files and a CSV file with nearly 40000 rows, each row consisting of a caption and the name of the image file that it decsribes.

This dataset can be found in kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/e1cd22253a9b23b073794872bf565648ddbe4f17e7fa9e74766ad3707141adeb. This file is too large to be uploaded here directly. 

The test examples folder includes 8 test images not in the original dataset that are used to test the performance of our model.
